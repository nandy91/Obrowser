Obrowser (Mini-Project September 2012)
An Android project developed for Android API 16. In this project we attempted to create an offline browser.

The content of the webpage is saved locally on the device thus ensuring offline accessibility to the web page. 
It is designed to permit the user to access large amounts of text data available online by saving it.
Developed using Android ADT plugin for Eclipse.
Used the in-memory SQLite database.
